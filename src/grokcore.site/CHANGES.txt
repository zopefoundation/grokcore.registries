Changes
=======

1.6 (unreleased)
----------------

- Moved the directive `site` from Grok to this package.

- Moved the component `Application` and all the related utilities from Grok
  to this package.


1.5 (2011-01-03)
----------------

- Moved IApplication and getApplication from the Grok package into
  this one.


1.4 (2010-11-01)
----------------

- Upped versions requirements for martian and grokcore.component.

1.3 (2010-10-18)
----------------

- Made package comply to repository policy.

- Update functional tests to only use zope.app.appsetup instead
  of zope.app.testing.

- Update functional tests not to require zope.app.zcmlfiles
  anymore.

1.2 (2009-12-20)
----------------

* Migrated imports from zope.app.component to zope.site.

1.1 (2009-09-18)
----------------

* Updated dependencies (added missing ones and added separate test
  dependencies).

* A local utility now implements IAttributeAnnotatable.

* Update code documentation from Grok itself.

* Use 1.0b2 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local
  copy; a local copy for all grokcore packages is just too hard to
  maintain.


1.0.1 (2009-06-30)
------------------

* Reupload to pypi with a correct version of Python which doesn't have
  a distutils bug.

1.0 (2009-06-29)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.site`` by factoring local site based components,
  grokkers and directives out of Grok.
