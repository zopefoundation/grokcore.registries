The grokcore.component API
==========================

The grokcore.component API is described by the
``grokcore.component.interfaces.IGrokcoreComponentAPI`` interface.
When you do

  >>> from grokcore.component import *

only those objects described in that API interface are imported into
your local namespace.  In other words, if we take the list of things
that have been imported and subtract the things that have been defined
in the API interface, we'll end with pretty much nothing:

  >>> from grokcore.component.interfaces import IGrokcoreComponentAPI
  >>> sorted(set(locals()) - set(IGrokcoreComponentAPI))
  ['IGrokcoreComponentAPI', '__builtins__', '__file__']
