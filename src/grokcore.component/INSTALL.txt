Preparing for grok development
------------------------------

Install setuptools on your system, or use a setuptools-based
environment like a "virtualenv" or a "buildout", and then install
"grokcore.component".  Doing it from the command line looks like::

    $ sudo easy_install -U grokcore.component

Then you can try importing it from your Python code.

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the "grokcore.component" tests, you need to download the source
code from version control and run the following command which the
buildout will create::

    $ bin/test
