grokcore.registries
===================

This package allows you to register (or `grok` in case of a use in a
Grok environment) components in custom and configurable registries.

It provides a `ZCML` directive that wraps your ZCML components
registration declarations and some base classes and utilities to
create your registries and interact with them.
